# Overview

This repository will be home of some snippets I find fascinating. Some of the layout will be portions of snippets I find interesting as well.

I am using `pug` for the templating, and `sass` for handling css. Pug is entirely new to me, and I'm fairly new to sass as well. At least at the point of writing this. I do, however have a small amount of experience with `less` which seems similar enough in concept.
